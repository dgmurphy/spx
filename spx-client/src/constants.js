 "On 21 February, BFB commanders met at an unknown location in the vicinity of Oghuz, " +
 "//MGRSCOORD: 38TQL070498//, in Vetlia Province, Atropia. The purpose of the meeting was " +
 "to plan attack operations aimed at unspecified Atropian targets. The commanders discussed " +
 "weapon acquisition details and planned attacks on Atropian targets. The attacks will " +
 "target Government facilities and non-Bilasuvar civilian gatherings using improvised " +
 "explosive devices (IED), NFI. " + 
 "Lukas ((Asif)), the Vetlia Province Deputy BFB Commander, Filip ((Fasihuddin)), " + 
 "a senior BFB commander, and Marek ((Zanjani)), a senior BF commander, attended " +
 "the meeting. These commanders decided that improvised explosive devices (IED) " +
 "would create the most panic and would allow the attacks to be carried out " +
 "without having a large number of BFB fighters present. " +
 "On 24 February, Fasihuddin conducted a follow-on meeting with Krzystof ((Iqbal)) " +
 "and Ondrej ((Fatemi)), at a BFB safehouse located in the vicinity of Gebele, " +
 "//MGRSCOORD: 38TQL407427//, Vetlia Province, Atropia. Iqbal, a senior BFB member " +
 "responsible for operational planning, assured the commanders that he could acquire " +
 "the components necessary to build the requested IEDs. Fatemi, a BFB member responsible " +
 " for transporting supplies from Donovia, provided an update on a shipment of rifles " +
 " and ammunition scheduled for delivery within the week. The arms shipment was in route " +
 " from a weapons dealer in Donovia, and being transported to an unidentified safe house " +
 " in northern Vetlia Province, NFI. "
